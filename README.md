# Gonzo_Klipper_Scripts

There are a lot of Klipper Macros available but nothing quite fit my usage or how I wanted things to work. 
These macros were taylored for the 350 Voron 2.4 but should work with all printers running Klipper.

# BE WARNED IF YOU FIND THESES SCRIPTS THEY ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT, SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK 100% BECAUSE I HAVENT TESTED EVERYTHING THROUGHLY.

I have amassed a buch of macros and wrote even more to come up with a fairly comprehensive collections of controls for printers running klipper.
There is no installer just yet, it's on my todo list... For now I have uploaded these for my own use and any power users who may come across these to use as they see fit. 

A lot of macros for add-ons are heavliy intigrated making this quite a mess for mass use. If certain add ons like led-effect aren't installed you will get a lot of command not found errors. 
I use an ERCF so Happy Hare is also pretty well intigrated into these macros. There are also a few changes to macros included with happy hare, lots of changes to blobifier and a set of maco helper for tuning.
I added a lot of options and checks in the macro_variables to mitigate errors and bypass features if not in use or supported by one's printer.
