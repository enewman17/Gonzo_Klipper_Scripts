 Klipper Scripts for the Voron 2.4 and other printers running klipper

Voron 2.4/Trident

There are a lot of Klipper Macros available but nothing quite fit my usage or how I wanted things to work. The following macros were specifically writen for the 350 Voron 2.4 but should work with just about all printers running Klipper. 

Many thanks to 

Justin Schuh: https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros A lot of code and ideas were borrowed from those macros.
