# Gonzo_Klipper_Scripts

Klipper Scripts for the Voron 2.4 and other printers running klipper
BE WARNED IF YOU FIND THESES SCRIPTS THEY ARE UNDER DIVELOPMENT, SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK 100% BECAUSE I HAVENT TESTED EVERYTHING THROUGHLY.
BUT ALL IN ALL EVERYTHING IN THE DAY TO DAY STUFF WORKS.

Voron 2.4/Trident

There are a lot of Klipper Macros available but nothing quite fit my usage or how I wanted things to work. The following macros were specifically writen for the 350 Voron 2.4 but should work with just about all printers running Klipper.

Many thanks to

Justin Schuh: <https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros> A lot of code and ideas were borrowed from those macros.

Added module to increase MAX_MCU_SIZE. This will allow you to increase the of number of neopixles in a string. the default is 125 or MAX_MCU_SIZE = 500
So many automations and macro helpers to tweak your printer to how you like it.
