# Gonzo_Klipper_Scripts

Klipper Scripts for the Voron 2.4 and other printers running klipper
BE WARNED IF YOU FIND THESES SCRIPTS THEY ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT, SOME THINGS MAY NOT WORK 100% BECAUSE I HAVENT TESTED EVERYTHING THROUGHLY.
BUT ALL IN ALL EVERYTHING IN THE DAY TO DAY STUFF WORKS.

I have amassed a buch of macros and wrote even more to come up with a fairly comprehensive collections of controls for printers running klipper.
There is no installer just yet, it's on my todo list... I started one but its not finised. Plus I need to iron out a lot of details for what to include. For now I have uploaded these for my own use and any power users who may come across these to use as they see fit. 

A lot of macros for add-ons are heavliy intigrated making this quite a mess for mass use. If certain add ons like led-effect aren't installed you will get a lot of errors. I use an ERCF so Happy Hare is also pretty well intigrated into these macros. I added a lot of options and checks in the macro_variables to mitigate errors and bypass features if not in use or supported by one's printer. 



Voron 2.4/Trident

There are a lot of Klipper Macros available but nothing quite fit my usage or how I wanted things to work. The following macros were specifically writen for the 350 Voron 2.4 but should work with just about all printers running Klipper.

Many thanks to

Justin Schuh: <https://github.com/jschuh/klipper-macros> A lot of code and ideas were borrowed from those macros.
